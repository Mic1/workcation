## Next 13 is a full stack framework,

### that coupled with React 18 allows us to implement an efficient and elegant architecture for both DX and UX by interleaving server and client components. Full stack ### because it gives the full power of React when needed to  client components, and keeps the static part of the app rendering on the server with server components to ### fetch data and stream it in as ready. No more Next 12  hydration on the client.

### The new Layout architecture of Next 13, components never renders unnecessarily as it only rerenders areas where data is added in.

### This necessitates a change of mind set to server-based thinking, where all components are server-based and client components are only used when they are needed.

### A side effect of this might be a reusable set of client components, as the use of Layouts and nested layouts with page subsections focused on client interaction clearly delegates a narrow band of behaviour for us to code into those client components.
